**Apple Clone Website**

This project is a clone of the Apple website created from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to replicate the design and functionality of the Apple website while ensuring responsiveness.
The project incorporates animation and scroll triggers using Locomotive Scroll and GSAP, while SwiperJS is used for implementing sliding functionality.
